# Bash Utils
Some bash utils

## alarm_timer:
Start a timer and play music when it reaches zero.

## automatic_screen_capture
Do a screenshot in a specified time intervall using shutter.

## pclock
Wrapper for the shutdown_and_restart to add logging capabilities.

## shutdown_and_restart
Suspends the computer for a certain time period, then turns it on again and plays some music. RTC alarm needs to be enabled in the BIOS/UEFI for this to work.

**and much more**

Note that some number scripts are not designed to be plug-and-play. They use absolute file paths, as they reference specific media files, or are in some other way not usable without modification.
