# This script is for taking very quick notes. If the
# notes are important they should be copied to a more
# permanent location after being written.
#
# The idea is that no matter where you are, you can
# quickly wip open a terminal and type qn.
#
# After writing down a note, you can rename it with
# :e . and then R. Ideally only append a descriptive
# name, and don't change the timestamp.
